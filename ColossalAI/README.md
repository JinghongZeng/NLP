## ColossalAI open-source pipeline to train a ChatGPT

- The "examples" folder comes from the path "applications/Chat" in [ColossalAI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI), with user changes.
It contains code to train a ChatGPT pipeline and generate predictions from the first stage. However, this folder lacks necessary model settings.
- The "setup" file decribes setting up the environment for modelling, including installing transformers.
